This is a CLI tool to emulate the features of a blog.

## Usage
All the different features are available through a menu printed in the console, then the required information is asked directly via user input.  
⚠️ On macOS it's required to manually create the directories used to store posts and comments, inside the user home folder (e.g. /Users/ciro23):
```
c-blog/
├── posts/
└── comments/
```

## Features
1. Create a post
2. Add a comment to a post
3. View a post and all its comments

## Support
It's currently supported on Unix-based systems only, and it was correctly tested on Linux and macOS.
